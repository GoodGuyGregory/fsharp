## Thinking Functionally:

**Core Concepts**

* There are no "Variables", only values
* functions are values that can be passed around as inputs to other functions

**Conventions**

Unlike C#, the naming convention for F# is that functions and values start with lowercase letters rather than uppercase (camelCase rather than PascalCase) unless designed for exposure to other .NET languages. Types and modules use uppercase however.
